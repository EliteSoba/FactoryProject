	/*GraphicKitAssemblyManager.java (350x720) - Tobias Lee
	 * This is the graphical display of the Kit Assembly Manager
	 * Currently, this displays a conveyer belt and its kits, and a kitting station
	 * and animates the two.
	 * 
	 * TODO: (ã)
	 * 		[ã] Rework GraphicKittingStation to hold ArrayList of GraphicKits 
	 * 			>Give them positions<, or have them slide down to the bottom?
	 * 				Second option is easier, but no way of confirming that bottom-most kit will be filled first. If Robot needs to target completed kits, then first option is just as viable
	 * 		[ã] Update GraphicKittingRobot movement to add kit to GraphicKittingStation
	 * 		[ã] Add functionality of GraphicKittingRobot to move from kitting station back to belt
	 * 		[ã] Update Conveyor Belt:
	 * 				Only belt - no other peripherals
	 * 				Belt only moves when kit enters/exits
	 * 		[ã]	READ APIS ON WIKI: https://github.com/usc-csci200-fall2012/team02/wiki/Agent-Graphics-API
	 * 		[ã]	RENAME METHODS FOR CONSISTENCY TO MATCH ^
	 * 		[ã] Create GraphicItems class to display rudimentary items
	 * 		[ã] Rework GraphicKit to be able to hold GraphicItems
	 * 		[ã] Rotation of GraphicKit
	 * 		[ã] Rework GraphicKittingRobot to actually hold kits rather than using an image with a blank kit
	 * 		[ã]	Update pathing of Robot
	 * 		[X] Add functionality of GraphicKittingStation to randomly add items to a kit
	 * 				NO LONGER NECCESSARY BECAUSE V1
	 * 		[X] Create buttons for each potential command in ControlPanel
	 * 				NO LONBER NECCESSARY BECAUSE V1
	 * 		[ã] Update GraphicKittingStation so that the positions of the kits are not as autistic
	 * 				GraphicKittingRobot must be able to pick which kit it removes
	 * 		[ã]	Get as much as possible out of this class and into their subclasses
	 * 		[ ]	ADD COMMENTS TO EVERYTHING
	 * 		[X] ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS ROBOT COMMANDS
	 * 				It can take 3 kits from the station at once...
	 * 				TOO MANY BRUTE FORCE SOLUTIONS. NEED ELEGANCE
	 * 				Queue of Command Strings would be kinda cool
	 * 				!- HANDLED BY 201 TEAM
	 * 		{ã} (Perhaps) Create a generic moveTo(int x, int y) function for GraphicKittingRobot to move to a location
	 * 		{ } Rework comments to have /**MESSAGE* / at the front of each method
	 * 				-LOW PRIORITY-
	 * 
	 * CURRENT ISSUES:
	 * 		[X] Hierarchy of commands: Robot will prioritize getting new kit from belt above all else
	 * 			- HARDFIXED FOR NOW. FIX LATER
	 * 			- HANDLE WHAT TO DO WHEN TOO MANY KITS ARE CIRCULATING (4TH KIT FROM BELT TRANSFERRING TO STATION)
	 * 			Are hardfixes really a bad thing?
